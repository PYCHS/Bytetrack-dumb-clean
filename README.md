# Bytetrack-dumb-clean

Create a bytetrack-llm to do refer tracking with a cleaner  code.

### Note

When adding to git a notebook whose cell outputs you want to keep, instead of the usual `git add <path to your notebook>`  command, use this: `git -c filter.strip-notebook-output.clean= add <path to your notebook>`
